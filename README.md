A simple blockchain system
</h3>

Noobcash is a simple cryptocurrency system. It is a completely decentralized digital currency, without any need for central authority. The transactions made in the system are verified by a network of nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger, the Noobcash Blockchain. The nodes in our system communicate via a peer-to-peer network using cryptography for the verification processes.
